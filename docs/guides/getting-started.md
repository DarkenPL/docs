# Getting Started

_Wherein we create a game from scratch with Paperize_

<!-- Note: Prefer to learn by watching? This guide has a video version: link. -->

## Start Paperize

In order to turn our game idea into a physical prototype as quickly as possible, we've decided to follow the Paperize workflow:

- design our game in a Google Spreadsheet
- organize the images in our Google Drive
- use Paperize.io to generate print-and-play PDF-files from those assets
- print, play, ponder, repeat

To start the process, we visit [Paperize.io](https://beta.editor.paperize.io).

## Logging In

Looking to the top right corner of the app, we click the "Sign In" menu item.

SIGN_IN_LINK_IMAGE

We are presented with a pop-out window that allows us to log in with our Google accounts.

GOOGLE_POP_OUT_IMAGE

After entering our credentials, we need to give Paperize access to our Google Drive and Google Sheets.

GOOGLE_PERMISSIONS_IMAGE

And that's it! Paperize will complete the login process, including creating a "Paperize.io" folder in our Google Drive, and dropping a special file in it, "paperize_database.json". You can view these details by clicking the "Database" menu item now visible at the top of the screen.
