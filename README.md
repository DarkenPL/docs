# Welcome to the Paperize Monorepo

Here you'll find:

- `editor`: a static javascript app hosted on S3
- `api`: the backend editor talks to, hosted on API Gateway + Lambda
- `pdf-renderer`: turns a game's json blob into a PDF, Ruby on Lambda

Each project has its own README, tests, development environments, and deployment scripts. Meta-scripts can be found in this root for running whole-project tests and checks.
