# Welcome to the Paperize Monorepo

Here you'll find:

- `editor`: a static JavaScript app hosted on S3
- `docs`: the app's documentation site, a Gridsome project that hosts on S3

Each project has its own README, tests, development environments, and deployment scripts. Meta-scripts can be found in this root for running whole-project tests and checks.
